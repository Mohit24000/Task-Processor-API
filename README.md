# Task-Processor-API
TaskProcessor is a Spring Boot–based application designed to manage and execute background tasks efficiently using asynchronous processing and retry mechanisms.
It provides a scalable architecture for handling tasks that may fail or require multiple attempts, ensuring reliability and resilience in distributed systems.

This project demonstrates the use of Spring AOP, @Async processing, custom configuration, and centralized exception handling — all essential patterns in enterprise-grade backend systems.
